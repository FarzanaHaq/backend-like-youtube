try...catch works like this:
try Block: This is where you put the code that might have problems. It's like making your sandwich. You're hoping everything goes well.

catch Block: This is where you handle the problems if they happen. If you run out of bread, you can handle it by maybe using a different type of bread or making a different snack.
